<h2>How does P2Win protect sellers?</h2>
<section class="article-info">
        <div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><span>We know that safety is important to you when selling online, so when selling on P2Win, all sellers are covered by the P2Win Guarantee and it’s free of charge! We take action to protect thousands of sellers on a daily basis and we’re constantly improving our system to make our marketplace as safe as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>Our P2Win Guarantee ensures that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Escrowed payments until delivery are confirmed. </strong><span>P2Win safeguards sellers from scams by safely holding the buyer’s payment in escrow. Unless the sold item is not delivered within a timely manner, buyers are not able to cancel the transaction, ensuring that the funds stay locked until the whole transaction is complete. </span><span>TIP: Use auto-delivery for digital goods when possible to receive your payments faster.</span></li>
<li><strong>Zero Chargeback Liability: </strong><span>When we approve an order, we stake our name on it. Sellers are granted a zero chargeback liability when selling on P2Win. If a buyer is trying to get an unauthorized refund (chargeback) or avoid paying for a return. P2Win takes the lead to resolve the issue with the payment providers and sellers can relax and focus on what matters the most, selling. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>We’ll help you work it out. </strong><span>If there’s a dispute between you and your buyer, P2Win will act as a mediator to help reach a resolution. Make sure to always register the steps of a transaction. If you are dealing with digital goods, take screenshots or record a video during the transfer process. If you are selling physical goods, take clear pictures of the product before packing and shipping it. <strong>Important:</strong> The receipts issued by a supplier or the store from where the Gift Card(s) came from should be kept for<strong> at least 6 months</strong> after the Gift Card has been sold here on P2Win, as it will serve as proof of legitimacy in case there is a future problem with the sold Gift Card.</span></li>
<li><strong>Reporting a buyer.</strong><span> Even though our team is monitoring the marketplace activities, you can also help us identify suspicious activities. If you feel that a buyer has violated our rules and policies, hit the “Report” button on the user’s profile. It takes few seconds and it will help us monitor buyers' activity even further, helping protect you and the whole P2Win community.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Once more, the P2Win Guarantee is available for free to all P2Win users. As long as both your account and listings are in check with our Terms of Service, you are covered.</span></p>
