<h1 style="font-size:16px; text-transform:uppercase;">P2 Win Terms of Use</h1>

<p>Last modified: March 25, 2023</p>

<h2 class="titulo">Welcome to P2 Win!</h2>
<p>
Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). Please read these Terms of Service ("Agreement" or “Terms”) carefully before using P2 Win Marketplace, P2 Win Studios, P2 Win’s websites, mobile apps, games, products, and any related services (collectively with P2 Win Marketplace and P2 Win Studios, the “Services”) offered by IJJI, INC. (doing business as "P2 Win").
</p>

<p>
This is a legally binding agreement, and you should read it carefully.  By installing, using, or otherwise accessing our Services, you (the "user" or "you") agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all users of the Services, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, or contributors of content, information and other materials or services.
</p>
<hr />
<br>
<h2>1. Use of Services</h2>
<h3>P2 Win Marketplace</h3>
<p>
P2 Win Marketplace, or “Marketplace”, acts as a venue to allow users who comply with P2 Win's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods. P2 Win is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, P2 Win has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. P2 Win does not pre-screen users (except for services that require an application) or the content or information provided by users. P2 Win cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction. 
</p>
<p>
Consequently, P2 Win does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. P2 Win cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. P2 Win encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the App. 
</p>
<p>
You agree that P2 Win Marketplace is a venue and as such P2 Win is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on P2 Win Marketplace. You use P2 Win Marketplace at your own risk.
</p>

<h3>P2 Win Studios</h3>
<p>
P2 Win Studios, or “Studios”, provides access to games, including online games, browser games, mobile games, social media games, and any other digital offers of games or interactive entertainment for any end devices (e.g., PCs, smartphones, tablets, connected devices such as streaming or set-top boxes and smart TVs) and/or online platforms (e.g., social networks), developed and/or published by P2 Win through P2 Win Studios' webpages or services provided by third-parties, such as app stores and social networks for games (the "Games").
</p>
<p>
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, P2 Win grants you a limited, nonexclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable right to use the following:  (a) the portions of the Games that are freely accessible, and (b) such other portions of the Games accessible on a “for-payment” basis, provided that you have paid the applicable fees. The license in the preceding sentence is (i) solely for your personal, non-commercial use and (ii) subject to your compliance at all times with these Terms.
</p>
<p>
You shall not use any part of the Games for any purpose other than as explicitly in these Terms.  You shall not use the Games if you have previously been (x) removed from using any part of the Services by P2 Win or (y) banned from playing any of the Games.  You shall not, under any circumstances, access or attempt to access the source code of any of the Games.
</p>
<p>
You understand that, for reasons that include, without limitation, system security and stability, the Games may require automatic updates, pre-loads, creation of new versions or other enhancements and, accordingly, the system requirements to use or access the Games may change over time. These Terms do not entitle you to future updates, new versions or other enhancements, although P2 Win may choose to provide such updates, new versions or other enhancements in its sole discretion.
</p>

<h2>4. Listing, Selling, and Buying on Marketplace</h2>
<h3>Listing Description</h3>
<p>
All listings on P2 Win Marketplace must be for sale. By listing an item, you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with P2 Win's policies. You also warrant that you have the full rights to sell the item, and that such selling will not violate any legal or contractual obligations to which you may be subject . You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your Marketplace shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing.
</p>

<h3>Binding Sale</h3>
<p>
Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items, and buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order, transfer the item, or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.</p>

<h3>Fee Avoidance</h3>
<p>
The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing physical items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding P2 Win transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission.
